# IOx â€” Profiling

IOx includes an embedded `pprof` exporter compatible with the [go pprof](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/) tool.

To use it, aim your favorite tool at your IOx host at the HTTP `debug/pprof/profile` endpoint.

# Use the Go `pprof` tool:

Example

```shell
; go tool pprof 'http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=5'
```

And you get output like:

```

# Use the built in flame graph renderer

IOx also knows how to render a flamegraph SVG directly if opened directly in the browser:

For example, if you aim your browser at an IOx server with a URL such as http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=5

You will see a beautiful flame graph such as
