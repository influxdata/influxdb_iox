# This crate contains the application-specific abstraction of the metrics
# implementation for IOx. Any crate that wants to expose telemetry should use
# this crate.
#
# The crate exposes a special type of metrics registry which allows users to
# isolate their metrics from the rest of the system so they can be tested
# in isolation.
