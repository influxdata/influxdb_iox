# This crate contains the application-specific abstraction of the metrics 
# implementation for IOx. Any crate that wants to expose telemetry should use 
# this crate. 
#
# The crate exposes a special type of metrics registry which allows users to 
# isolate their metrics from the rest of the system so they can be tested 
# in isolation.
