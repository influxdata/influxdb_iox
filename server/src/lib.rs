//! This crate contains code that defines the logic for a running InfluxDB IOx
//! server. It also has the logic for how servers talk to each other, which
//! includes replication, subscriptions, querying, and traits that abstract
//! these methods away for testing purposes.
//!
//! This diagram shows the lifecycle of a write coming into a set of IOx servers
//! configured in different roles. This doesn't include ensuring that the
//! replicated writes are durable, or snapshotting partitions in the write
//! buffer. Have a read through the comments in the source before trying to make
//! sense of this diagram.
//!
//! Each level of servers exists to serve a specific function, ideally isolating
//! the kinds of failures that would cause one portion to go down.
//!
//! The router level simply converts the line protocol to the flatbuffer format
//! and computes the partition key. It keeps no state.
//!
//! The HostGroup/AZ level is for receiving the replicated writes and keeping
//! multiple copies of those writes in memory before they are persisted to
//! object storage. Individual databases or groups of databases can be routed to
//! the same set of host groups, which will limit the blast radius for databases
//! that overload the system with writes or for situations where subscribers lag
//! too far behind.
//!
//! The Subscriber level is for actually pulling in the data and making it
//! available for query through indexing in the write buffer or writing that
//! data out to Parquet in object storage. Subscribers can also be used for
//! real-time alerting and monitoring.
