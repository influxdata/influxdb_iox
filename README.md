# Project Delorean

To compile and run this, you'll need:

- Stable Rust
- The [`flatc` flatbuffer compiler](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_building.html) >= 1.12.0
- `.env` file in the directory to specify configuration options. You can see an example in the `env` file.


## Contributing:
- Delorean is written mostly in idiomatic Rust -- please see the [Style Guide](docs/style_guide.md) for more details.
